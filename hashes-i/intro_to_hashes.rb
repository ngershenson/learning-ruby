# Intro to Hashes
#
# A hash is a data structure consisting of key-value pairs.
# A key is an identifier for a value.
# A hash solves the problem of association (connecting two values together).
#
# Example: Restaurant menu connects a food item to a price
# Example: A dictionary connects a word to a definition
#
# Rules of a Hash
# Hash keys must be unique
# Hash values can contain duplicates.
# Hash values are extracted by key, not by order.
