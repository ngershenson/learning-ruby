# BLOCKS
#
# A block is a chunk of code to execute
# An argument is an object we pass a method, while a block is a procedure
# A block cannot exist without a method
# A block is a temporary construct
#
# BLOCKS VS METHODS
#
# Methods can be invoked over and over
# A block is used only once then disappears
# Methods capture the repeatable steps of a procedure
# A block captures the custom step of a procedure
